## About The Project

This game will be made for the [GMTK Jam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam-2022) hosted by Game Makers Toolkit. 

Randoween is a tower defense game where the enemies in a wave and the buildings you can place are decided by the roll of a dice. Will you try to succeed with what you get? Or will you try your luck and re-roll?
